# TowerDefence

This is a simple tower defense game I developed to improve my skills and expand my portfolio. The project is still ongoing. I try to adhere to SOLID principles, OOP methodologies and clean code practices as much as possible. I also focus on optimization and write code that allows Game Designers to work more comfortably, allowing easier level and wave editing from the inspector.

I used the following technologies and design patterns in the architecture of this project: Scriptable Objects, Dependency Injection (Partially-Zenject), Object Pooling, DoTween, Factory Design Pattern, Singleton Design Pattern, Strategy Design Pattern and Observer Design Pattern (Events).
